  lead: My name is Dr. Ursula Amiot and I am glad you’re here
  text: 'As the owner of Amiot Spine Care, my mission is to provide
    compassionate patient care and education for back pain, neck pain,
    headaches, and muscle pain. I have been treating patients for over 16 years
    and I pride myself on listening to my patient’s needs, being a trusted
    advocate, and providing best practice, patient centered care, to everyone I
    treat.


    I have a Bachelor of Science degree from the Minnesota State University at
    Mankato, a Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine from Northwestern Health Sciences
    University. Additionally I am studying for a Diplomate in Pediatric care and
    pregnancy. I was in private practice in Mahtomedi and in 2006 I had the
    privilege of becoming an associate professor at Northwestern Health Sciences
    University, where I treated patients and trained students interns. Most
    recently, I spent the past 7 years as a Chiropractor at HealthPartners Hugo
    and White Bear Lake Clinics.


    I live in White Bear Lake area with my husband and our two girls. We enjoy
    traveling, golfing, skiing in the winter, and enjoying time on our boat in
    the summer.

faqs: '#### What is Chiropractic?

  Chiropractors treat back pain by adjusting your body with a focus on the
  spine. We use our hand or specialized instruments to apply safe, controlled
  force to your joints to help correct dysfunction and decrease your pain.
  Adjustments also stimulate your body’s natural healing abilities. We will
  discuss your condition and whether chiropractic care can be a benefit for you
  and stretches will be discussed. At Amiot Spine Care, it usually takes about
  six visits to complete your personalized treatment plan. But you’ll start to
  feel better as soon as your first appointment and continue to heal throughout
  your treatments.

  #### Is Chiropractic care right for me?

  If neck and back pain, joint pain/stiffness, nerve pain or muscle pain makes
  it hard to work, get through your daily routines or do what you enjoy, then
  chiropractic may be an option you want to explore. Chiropractors treat
  problems affecting your bones, muscles, nerves and joints by adjusting your
  body, with a focus on the spine. Chiropractic adjustments help correct
  dysfunctions in your body’s structure, promote pain relief and boost your
  ability to heal. Chiropractors can also offer personalized insights and
  education on how you can work and play more safely, helping you independently
  manage and reduce pain in your day-to-day life.


  Chiropractors typically treat the following musculoskeletal conditions:


  - Back Pain

  - Neck pain

  - Headaches

  - Sports injuries

  - Arthritis pain

  - Bursitis

  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

  - Fibromylgia

  - Herniated discs

  - Arm & Leg Pain

  - Plantar fasciitis

  - Pain During Pregnancy

  - Strains and Sprains

  - Rotator Cuff Injuries

  - Sciatica

  - Spinal stenosis


  #### How many treatments can I expect to have?

  Most conditions typically respond in 6-8 visits. My goal is to treat you with
  the minimal number of visits and provide self-care information so that you are
  able to continue to make improvements after your treatment is complete and you
  can get back to doing what you love.

  #### What if I don’t know the cause of my pain?

  Sometimes, it’s hard to be specific about the kind of pain you’re feeling. My
  approach is to listen to your concerns and help identify the root cause of
  your pain and treat it. If I find that your pain isn’t related to a
  musculoskeletal condition, I will refer you to someone who is better able to
  help you.

  #### Do you accept insurance?

  At this time, Amiot Spine Care does not accept insurance.
  Payment is due at the time of service. We strive to keep our rates affordable and transparent so that you can receive high-quality care without the complications of insurance billing.

  Many patients find that chiropractic care is a cost-effective investment in their health, and we are happy to provide a receipt for you to submit to your insurance company or Health Savings Account (HSA) if applicable.
  If you have any questions about payment or pricing, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

  #### Do I have to get imaging done?

  On occasion, further tests such as x-rays are required to determine the source
  of your pain. For most cases of back pain imaging is unnecessary. Dr. Amiot
  will do a complete history and exam to determine if imaging is necessary.

  #### Is chiropractic treatment safe during pregnancy?

  Chiropractic care offers a safe alternative to pain medications for pregnant
  women. Chiropractic treatment can help with back pain, hip pain, and leg pain
  related to pregnancy. Dr. Amiot will modify therapies as needed to ensure
  safety. Dr. Amiot is certified in Webster Technique for pregnancy.

  #### Do I need a referral to see a chiropractor?

  No, you do not need a referral to see a chiropractor.'
